# push_swap
he Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.
